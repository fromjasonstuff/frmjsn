We didn't have dopamine machines fine-tuning content to our worst neurosis.\n\nNow, at 43, with age and self-education on my side, I have better tools to analyze the material conditions of my world. But my sense of justice has always remained. \n\nThis epidemic of young boys and men who understand enough about the world to know it's unjust but are not educated enough to know who to listen to is, in no small part, a problem with neoliberalism. Upper-middle-class people with wide-reaching influence on the web have spent the last decade telling poor people that there's nothing wrong with the system, the economy is fine, etc. \n\nWe turned our backs on these people. Of course, bad actors were there, willing to take them captive.\n\nThis is what makes the horseshoe theory complete bullshit. It derives from a false dichotomy. Liberal vs. Conservative is just a country-wide family fued over land and power between the bourgeoisie. What we are witnessing is not ideologies going so far left it ends up on the right. It's people understanding that the system is unfixable and the divide comes from who we choose to blame for it. Everyone else, liberal and conservative alike, are champions of the status quo, where the divide comes from who gets to rule over it all. \n\nIt's not left and right, it's up and down. \n",
