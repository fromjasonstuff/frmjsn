				"content_text": "# BlogMix 2023 Wrap-up Vol. 1 \r\n\r\nFor the new year, I’m sharing my favorite bookmarks of 2023 to my [microblog](https://micro.fromjason.xyz). I will post “blogmixes” as a series of volumes. I don’t know how categorized these will end up, but I plan to post the entire collection on my [main site](https://www.fromjason.xyz) towards the end.\r\n\r\nAs a caveat for the entire BlogMix series, any links I share are because I thought something about the content was interesting, important, wonderful, horrible, or otherwise noteworthy. Including a link does not necessarily mean I agree with a particular message. I considered labeling the links where I don’t agree, but that felt like it took the fun out of the project a bit. We’ll see. This is a new and evolving idea for me.\r\n\r\nFor this first volume, I included some posts and articles that I’ve either read, rediscovered, or revisited in 2023.

Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say.
