But the way they‚Äôre shared on Facebook means that next to no one is actually clicking through to read them. In fact, according to the site‚Äôs own traffic counts, **that anti-Protestant post only has 23 views, but its Facebook post has over 7,000 reactions and a thousand comments**. And it's those thousand comments that are the key here.\n\nWeird Christian infighting aside, those figures are wild. I mean, if you told me that 23 people *accidentally* clicked on his post I'd believe you. \n\nThis tells me two things:\n\n1. Rage bait is a poor way to generate an audience. \n2. People who spend too much time in rushing streams of content are incapable of enjoying anything longer than a headline. \n\nAnyway, I think it's time to reread *[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)*. \n",
