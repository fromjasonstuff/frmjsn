<p>Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured Friday at a federal prison in Arizona, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/">In 2020, Two Thirds of Google Searches Ended Without a Click</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From January to December, 2020, <strong>64.82% of searches</strong> on Google (desktop and mobile combined) ended in the search results without clicking to another web property. That number is likely undercounting some mobile and nearly all voice searches, and thus it’s probable that more than 2/3rds of all Google searches are what I’ve been calling “zero-click searches.”</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s largest scrapper site was once a search engine.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m using defined tags to filter my public bookmarks. Posts with lots of ads will be tagged as &ldquo;<strong>adicles</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;posts&rdquo; tag is exclusive to personal &ldquo;sites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; come from &ldquo;orgs&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies,&rdquo; so forth, and so on.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

			 <p>I wanted my micro.blog bookmarks public and filtered, so I did some digging:</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> has a great <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-bookmarks-shortcode">public bookmarks plug-in</a>. Effortless setup.</p>
<p>I then stumbled on <a href="https://micro.blog/pratik">@pratik</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/2023/08/15/thanks-to-heylouras.html">post</a> sharing their <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/faves/">faves page</a>, which led me to <a href="https://micro.blog/heyloura">@heyloura</a>&rsquo;s code to <a href="https://paste.lol/loura/micro-blog-bookmarks-shortcode">filter bookmarks by tag</a>.</p>
<p>I get to work on my bookmarks page today because of their contributions. Hooray for smart and generous people.</p>

<p>Writing is thinking. iA Writer is designed to make thinking enjoyable. A writing app that thinks for you is a robot that does your jogging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>

<p>Maybe my favorite internet manifesto. I go back to it often because it&rsquo;s incredibly funny prose. But also, when I&rsquo;m itching to complicate things, I need it to reel me in. Even if it&rsquo;s satire.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&rsquo;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a wild conspiracy theory that iPhone&rsquo;s Emergency Satellite service is a precursor to a fully-Apple cellular network. What better way to kick off the new service than with a satellite-connected  MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll be first in line for a Mac I can use without coffee shop WiFi.</p>
