<p>If you haven’t heard of Worldcoin before, buckle up. Worldcoin is the OpenAI CEO’s cryptocurrency project, which aims to redistribute wealth to the people after artificial intelligence captures all the world’s money. You sign into Worldcoin with a scan of your eyeball through a giant metal orb (stay with me), so the company hopes to also become the internet’s default verification system. Users of mainstream internet platforms like Minecraft and Shopify can now “verify their humanness” with the World ID, and Altman’s vision for Worldcoin got one step closer to reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they invite both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded inevitably results in the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great read. We&rsquo;re seeing the worst of SaaS; tech companies becoming so powerful that they can defraud their customers in broad daylight. The worst part is, not a single politician has any interest in regulating the companies they hold stock in.</p>

<p>Reached for comment, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky did not deny that Apple has successfully blocked Beeper Mini. “If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is&hellip; if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, &hellip;&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, if Apple cared about security, why did they block a company whose entire business model hinged on faking iDevice authenticity? /s</p>
<p>Must say though, it was an impressive feat made possible by a sixteen year old who reverse engineered Apple&rsquo;s messaging system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The process by which push notifications are generated requires the phone company to serve as a “digital post office,” Wyden wrote. Push notifications are sent through Apple and Google&rsquo;s servers, which means that the companies “serve as intermediaries in the transmission process,” and can therefore be made to hand over information to governments that request it.</p>
<p>According to Wyden’s letter, the information that can be gleaned from push notification requests is mostly metadata. This includes information “detailing which app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be delivered,” Wyden wrote. In some cases, requesters may even receive unencrypted content such as the text that was delivered in the notification.</p>
<p>The senator said that companies can therefore “be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p>

			 <p>Regarding ad blockers:</p>
<p>The web wasn&rsquo;t always for-profit. In fact, it was decidedly free and open for a time. Most people were content with how the internet was before corporations came and decided to monetize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much an unwillingness to support platforms via ads; it&rsquo;s that some people are simply rejecting in its entirety the forced participation of the for-profit web.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t kill off all the indie platforms and then get mad when people don&rsquo;t fall in line.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, and I know it sounds pedantic. AI isn&rsquo;t taking anything away from anyone. Rich <em>people</em> are taking jobs away from poorer people, in order to enrich themselves further; as the story always goes.</p>
<p>These very wealthy <em>people</em> just happen to be using AI at the moment to accomplish their ongoing fetish for working class suffering.</p>
<p>This actually works out great for us. Because <em>people</em> have phone numbers and addresses. Chatbots do not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only person that can safely discern human from artificial text is the person writing. iA Writer now supports making the distinction. There’s no fancy ghost doing this for you. It’s up to you to decide how honest you want to be with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new version of <strong>iA Writer</strong> ( <em>not</em> AI Writer) will keep track of the text you paste from ChatGPT into the its app. Authorship is displayed at the end of the document. iA calls the new open format <a href="https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Annotations">Markdown Annotations</a>, and hopes other developers expand on it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think writers have soured on generative AI. Most won&rsquo;t go near it as a matter of religious conviction, so I wonder which will embrace this compromise. iA Writer is a <em>writer&rsquo;s</em> writer app. There seems to be a strong dichotomy between who uses services like ChatGPT and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s opinions on new things do soften over time, however, right? I kind of love that the folks at <a href="https://ia.net/">Information Architects</a> found a way to incorporate AI without minimizing creative efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, you sometimes must declare your pasted text as AI-generated. Pasting from desktop appears to auto-detect from ChatGPT. Most companies like OpenAI and Midjourney don&rsquo;t seem too interested in creating a digital watermark for AI content, which I suspect would help here. It&rsquo;s a problem. <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/madonna-in-the-80s-ai-already-tainting-our-history/">Ask Madonna</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I titled this post <em>iA Writer 7 keeps you honest</em>, but on further reflection I think it does more than that. I think it gives skittish writers permission to use AI without feeling like a fraud. Our memories aren&rsquo;t always that great. And we sometimes forget to look back at our work with kind eyes. No one wants to read an old post and wonder if some AI prose slipped in. I don&rsquo;t use AI for writing anything other than work outlines. But I can see value in a GPT assistant helping me flush out ideas. The ability to do that and document the process is pretty cool.</p>

<p>I love the way certain styles cluster over time. Or how some aesthetics appear once then disappear, while others maintain an ebb and flow that can span decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pentagram saw an opportunity to turn Snoo into a character as iconic as Super Mario and cement its role as Reddit’s mascot by formalizing its shape and details. This process involved taking the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendering it in 3D, with the kind of nuanced character development that goes into designing Pixar characters. Snoo’s new 3D form—and a new menu of emoji-like Snoos—opens the door for the character’s next act. It also lays the groundwork for a new core illustration style, transitioning from spot illustrations that lack a common thread, to heroic 3D icons, all unified in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the industrial firms that Marx and Smith wrote about, tech firms like Google differ in one key aspect: how they turn a profit. Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say. For companies like Google, rent comes from owning the infrastructure through which we live our digital lives. The vast majority of Google’s windfall profits—$60 billion in 2022—come from rents.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>From January to December, 2020, <strong>64.82% of searches</strong> on Google (desktop and mobile combined) ended in the search results without clicking to another web property. That number is likely undercounting some mobile and nearly all voice searches, and thus it’s probable that more than 2/3rds of all Google searches are what I’ve been calling “zero-click searches.”</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m using defined tags to filter my public bookmarks. Posts with lots of ads will be tagged as &ldquo;<strong>adicles</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;posts&rdquo; tag is exclusive to personal &ldquo;sites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; come from &ldquo;orgs&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies,&rdquo; so forth, and so on.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>
