			 <p>FAANG (Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google) is an outdated paradigm for how we quantify ownership of the internet.</p>
<p>While the companies are mostly unchanged, it&rsquo;s no longer about internet traffic, or even stock prices. It&rsquo;s about a mass retreat to good ol' fashioned infrastructure monopolies.</p>
<p>The internet has a new MAAMA— Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Apple (I&rsquo;m sorry for the acronym) and they&rsquo;re here to claim cloud computing for the next quarter century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even with ActivityPub taking off, Bluesky is ready to have its moment in the spotlight again. Starting this week, the app is removing its invite system and throwing open its doors to anyone who wants to sign up. And later this month, it plans to begin letting outside developers host their own servers on its underlying AT Protocol that’s designed to rival ActivityPub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Threads, this has always felt more like Jack vs Zuck, than ActivityPub vs AT Protocol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2021, the semiconductor industry reportedly produced about 1.15 trillion units (Kharpal, 2022). As calculated above, the production of high-end AI chips in 2022 was likely less than 3 million. This suggests that high-end AI chips only accounted for less than 1:4,000 (0.00026%) of all chips produced.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this article is the closest thing we have to understanding the Threads / Mastodon interpolation initiative. At the very least, it gives us a framework to understand what feels like a heavily coordinated march.</p>
<p>What really drives this home; what transforms it from a simple article into a manifesto, is the ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have to live in the world the new technocrats are designing for us. We do not have to acquiesce to their growing project of dehumanization and data mining. Each of us has agency.</p>
<p>No more “build it because we can.” No more algorithmic feedbags. No more infrastructure designed to make the people less powerful and the powerful more controlling. Every day we vote with our attention; it is precious, and desperately wanted by those who will use it against us for their own profit and political goals. Don’t let them.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s wild looking back at file share with hindsight. In the 80s and 90s, record labels poured champagne off of looted artist royalties.</p>
<p>When #Napster hit, those same labels shed crocodile tears. They promised that artist would get their fair due if only we could kill file sharing.</p>
<p>Now that everything is locked behind DRM, artists are getting screwed more now than ever, and distributors are yanking our purchased digital assets from our libraries at will.</p>
<p>Anyone who shills for corporations in the name of regular folks, immediately gets the side eye from me. Because that story only has one ending and they know it.</p>

			 <p>A quick rant on that 2023 &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">Google memo</a> <em>&ldquo;We Have No Moat And neither does OpenAI&rdquo;</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, does this entire memo smell of bullshit; a red herring; the ol' pit us against the lunch lady routine.</p>
<p>First, it implies Google and OpenAI are on equal footing. They&rsquo;re not. Google is far better suited to cash in on AI tech adoption—more on that in a sec.</p>
<p>It then identifies open-source AI models as the third faction about to &ldquo;eat [Google&rsquo;s] lunch.&rdquo; Again, <em>basura, bro</em>. Straight trash.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, open-source tech is great and important, and wonderful. But it&rsquo;s not like the average person runs a Large Language Model on their Mac to make grocery lists. If you are, in fact, doing this, you are a nerd and I love you. But you&rsquo;re not the average user.</p>
<p>Most AI-centered features, whether powered by open or proprietary tech, will be baked into consumer-facing software for mass consumption.</p>
<p>But, AI features are power-hogs and expensive to maintain. Look at ChatGPT. With one hundred million users and close to two billion in revenue, OpenAI is <em>losing</em> money. There&rsquo;ll be efficiency gains for sure. But not before they pay the pied piper.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my final point.</p>
<p>The SaaS model runs on the cloud. The cloud is effectively owned by three companies— Amazon, Microsoft, and, yes, Google. (Four companies if you count Meta, but that&rsquo;s <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/copy-acquire-kill-how-meta-could-pull-off-the-most-extraordinary-pivot-in-tech-history/">another rant</a>).</p>
<p>The big three are spending eye-watering amounts of capex dollars on data centers and reporting growth almost exclusively from cloud services. And that&rsquo;s without ubiquitous AI in all of our subscription software that folks actually want to use.</p>
<p><em>So go ahead</em>, says Google. Be fruitful and multiply those AI features. Open-source it up. We&rsquo;ll even give you the tech for free. Just call us when you launch your app and need that cloud service.</p>
<p>Because why give a shit who sells the milk jars when you own the motherfucking cows, baby!</p>

<p>This &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is presumably part of the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Initiative</a> funded by Meta and Google. Out of morbid curiosity, I tried it.</p>
<p>On its website, DTI states it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;organization dedicated to the mission of empowering technology users.&rdquo; Cool.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that Big Tech figured out it was better to trade our data amongst themselves, like baseball cards— I&rsquo;ll trade you this pregnancy announcement for that postpartum diagnosis.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first time I tried the transfer, Meta shot an error with a message that it needed more permissions. I granted. The second time, it created an empty folder in my Google Drive. The third time+, it stopped responding.</p>

<p>Vegas casinos famously design their interiors like mazes without a single clock in sight. Why? Average time on site. The longer you’re inside their doors, the more money you will spend. But, what if The Bellagio didn’t own the building, and the landlord decided to give each visitor a map and then put up clocks on every wall. It would likely hurt business, yeah?”</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m listing some blog platform recommendations for a friend, so figured I should just make that list public.</p>
<p><strong>The following are platforms I&rsquo;m familiar with:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>: Simple and loved in the blogging community. I believe it&rsquo;s free with a paid option. If I didn&rsquo;t have a custom site, I&rsquo;d probably use Bear, or Write.as.</p>
<p><a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a>: Also simple and loved. No free version though. Price starts at $6/mo. I used write.as for a few months and enjoyed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>: Nostalgia! I love this concept. I haven&rsquo;t been through the set up process, but it looks like you may need to know some basic HTML/CSS. There&rsquo;s a social element with featured blogs. Service is free with a paid option. Some of my favorite blogs are on NeoCities.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>: Feature-rich. Geared toward professional publishers, but anyone can use. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, might be overkill. I used Ghost a few years ago, before its glow-up. It&rsquo;s a great platform. Starts at $9/mo. If you&rsquo;re adventurous, self-hosting a ghost blog is much cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>: Simple to use but has some cool features. There&rsquo;s also a social element which I like. I use micro.blog daily for sharing interesting links. But long-form works just fine. Starts at $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>: Their blog feature &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; is still in beta. But I&rsquo;m adding them to the list because I love their service so much. It&rsquo;s also sort of difficult to explain. You get your own web address, a linktree-esque webpage, a Mastodon account on their server, plus some other cool stuff for $20/year. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>A few platforms I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with but looked cool</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a>: described as Tumblr meets Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthaven.com/">PostHaven</a>: Up to ten blogs for $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im/">Blot</a>: Turns a folder into a website.</p>
<p><a href="https://typeshare.co/home">TypeShare</a>: Comes with an idea generator and outliner</p>
<p>A few recommends from the Mastodon community after posting:</p>
<p><em>Note: Some of these perhaps fall on the more technie side and may require some set up.</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://smol.pub/">smol.pub</a>: &ldquo;Your journal on the small net.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://prose.sh/">prose.sh</a>: &ldquo;a blog platform for hackers&rdquo; (hell yeah)</p>
<p><a href="https://mataroa.blog/">mataroa.blog</a>: &ldquo;Naked blogging platform, for minimalists. Just write.&rdquo; (Love)</p>
<p><a href="https://telegra.ph/">telegra.ph</a>: Opens to a blank canvas and a publish button. Nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://pika.page/">pika.page</a>: &ldquo;Pika makes blogging easy and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s some interesting parallels between the <strong>Technocracy movement</strong> of the 1930s and 40s, and a contemporary movement known as <strong>Effective Altruism</strong>.</p>
<p>Both ideologies promise a techno-utopia, if only we&rsquo;d give the world to its believers.</p>
<p>And both share some lineage— Joshua Norman Haldeman, 1940s director of Technocracy Inc, is the grandfather of Effective Altruism&rsquo;s most powerful evangelist, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What a gnarly little coincidence.</p>

<p>Guess which social platform has an outright ban on political ads? I&rsquo;ll give you a hint— it&rsquo;s the only social media platform in US history with bipartisan support to outlaw it.</p>

			 <p>Thinking about a #Meta pivot to infrastructure, and the subtle physiological effects it would have on our social media behavior.</p>
<p>The average user might keep their #Threads account, but signup for other platforms in the #Metaverse as &ldquo;sub-identities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example— Taylor Swift launches a super fans platform. Would the average Swiftie migrate to the Meta-interoperable space? Or would they make a new account, one that perhaps better represents their fandom identity?</p>

<p>You recognize that bad shit can happen, and that if you want to be a real techno optimist, you look for ways to minimize the bad and promote the good. That’s the optimism: that with some effort we can make sure that the good of technology outweighs the bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy New Year</p>

<p>So many great creations sent to the internet archives. And what an amazing project that is.</p>
<p>It would be cool though if a trust existed (maybe it does?) that would pay in perpetuity domain and hosting fees through scholarship. Once a year, indie creators who&rsquo;ve contributed important works on the web are entered.</p>

<p>For the new year, I’m sharing my favorite bookmarks of 2023 to my <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz">microblog</a>. I will post “blogmixes” as a series of volumes. I don’t know how categorized these will end up, but I plan to post the entire collection on my <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz">main site</a> towards the end.</p>
<p>As a caveat for the entire BlogMix series, any links I share are because I thought something about the content was interesting, important, wonderful, horrible, or otherwise noteworthy. Including a link does not necessarily mean I agree with a particular message. I considered labeling the links where I don’t agree, but that felt like it took the fun out of the project a bit. We’ll see. This is a new and evolving idea for me.</p>
<p>For this first volume, I included some posts and articles that I’ve either read, rediscovered, or revisited in 2023. I’ll almost certainly do another volume of just posts. Enjoy:</p>

<p>New plan: Each day I&rsquo;ll post a handful of links to my micro. Then, I&rsquo;ll categorize a big list on my main site next week. Is that a better plan? We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next major development in email deliverability included the standardization of reputation scores. ‘SenderScore’ and other reputation systems emerged at this time. False positives were further reduced by adding sender authentication mechanisms like Sender Policy Framework, SenderID, and Domainkeys Identified Mail.
Of course, if you&rsquo;re familiar with how these technologies work then you&rsquo;ll notice that most of them are reliant upon centralized gatekeepers who assign IP addresses and control domain registrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that’s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” is arguing for.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about whether Meta can track us across the web. They don&rsquo;t need to the moment we start generating content for them.</p>
<p>Meta has proven time and again that it has no problem with using people&rsquo;s own data to affect their moods and actions.</p>

			 <p>The most popular site on Facebook right now is a&hellip; blog? I mean, it&rsquo;s a Catholic fundamentalist blog, but still one for our side I guess, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, as you might expect, there are hundreds of Catholic Fundamentalism blog posts that would be deeply controversial in most religious circles (“A protestant is a person who willfully disobeys Any Word of Christ” is a doozy). But the way they’re shared on Facebook means that next to no one is actually clicking through to read them. In fact, according to the site’s own traffic counts, <strong>that anti-Protestant post only has 23 views, but its Facebook post has over 7,000 reactions and a thousand comments</strong>. And it&rsquo;s those thousand comments that are the key here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weird Christian infighting aside, those figures are wild. I mean, if you told me that 23 people <em>accidentally</em> clicked on his post I&rsquo;d believe you.</p>
<p>This tells me two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rage bait is a poor way to generate an audience.</li>
<li>People who spend too much time in rushing streams of content are incapable of enjoying anything longer than a headline.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they invite both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded inevitably results in the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great read. We&rsquo;re seeing the worst of SaaS; tech companies becoming so powerful that they can defraud their customers in broad daylight. The worst part is, not a single politician has any interest in regulating the companies they hold stock in.</p>

<p>Reached for comment, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky did not deny that Apple has successfully blocked Beeper Mini. “If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is&hellip; if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, &hellip;&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, if Apple cared about security, why did they block a company whose entire business model hinged on faking iDevice authenticity? /s</p>
<p>Must say though, it was an impressive feat made possible by a sixteen year old who reverse engineered Apple&rsquo;s messaging system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The process by which push notifications are generated requires the phone company to serve as a “digital post office,” Wyden wrote. Push notifications are sent through Apple and Google&rsquo;s servers, which means that the companies “serve as intermediaries in the transmission process,” and can therefore be made to hand over information to governments that request it.</p>
<p>According to Wyden’s letter, the information that can be gleaned from push notification requests is mostly metadata. This includes information “detailing which app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be delivered,” Wyden wrote. In some cases, requesters may even receive unencrypted content such as the text that was delivered in the notification.</p>
<p>The senator said that companies can therefore “be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p>

			 <p>Regarding ad blockers:</p>
<p>The web wasn&rsquo;t always for-profit. In fact, it was decidedly free and open for a time. Most people were content with how the internet was before corporations came and decided to monetize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much an unwillingness to support platforms via ads; it&rsquo;s that some people are simply rejecting in its entirety the forced participation of the for-profit web.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t kill off all the indie platforms and then get mad when people don&rsquo;t fall in line.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, and I know it sounds pedantic. AI isn&rsquo;t taking anything away from anyone. Rich <em>people</em> are taking jobs away from poorer people, in order to enrich themselves further; as the story always goes.</p>
<p>These very wealthy <em>people</em> just happen to be using AI at the moment to accomplish their ongoing fetish for working class suffering.</p>

			 <p>The shift away from the preverbal &ldquo;for you&rdquo;— finite, human-curated— and to towards the explicit &ldquo;For You&rdquo;— endless, algorithm-driven, bespoke— has stripped us of a sort of transparent &ldquo;social authority&rdquo; we once had with the hyperlinked-curated web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Influencer,&rdquo; &ldquo;thought-leader,&rdquo; etc. are now tainted terms. But we still enjoy recommendations by those with &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; and implicit standards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only person that can safely discern human from artificial text is the person writing. iA Writer now supports making the distinction. There’s no fancy ghost doing this for you. It’s up to you to decide how honest you want to be with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new version of <strong>iA Writer</strong> ( <em>not</em> AI Writer) will keep track of the text you paste from ChatGPT into the its app. Authorship is displayed at the end of the document. iA calls the new open format <a href="https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Annotations">Markdown Annotations</a>, and hopes other developers expand on it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think writers have soured on generative AI. Most won&rsquo;t go near it as a matter of religious conviction, so I wonder which will embrace this compromise. iA Writer is a <em>writer&rsquo;s</em> writer app. There seems to be a strong dichotomy between who uses services like ChatGPT and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s opinions on new things do soften over time, however, right? I kind of love that the folks at <a href="https://ia.net/">Information Architects</a> found a way to incorporate AI without minimizing creative efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, you sometimes must declare your pasted text as AI-generated. Pasting from desktop appears to auto-detect from ChatGPT. Most companies like OpenAI and Midjourney don&rsquo;t seem too interested in creating a digital watermark for AI content, which I suspect would help here. It&rsquo;s a problem. <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/madonna-in-the-80s-ai-already-tainting-our-history/">Ask Madonna</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I titled this post <em>iA Writer 7 keeps you honest</em>, but on further reflection I think it does more than that. I think it gives skittish writers permission to use AI without feeling like a fraud. Our memories aren&rsquo;t always that great. And we sometimes forget to look back at our work with kind eyes. No one wants to read an old post and wonder if some AI prose slipped in. I don&rsquo;t use AI for writing anything other than work outlines. But I can see value in a GPT assistant helping me flush out ideas. The ability to do that and document the process is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Pentagram saw an opportunity to turn Snoo into a character as iconic as Super Mario and cement its role as Reddit’s mascot by formalizing its shape and details. This process involved taking the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendering it in 3D, with the kind of nuanced character development that goes into designing Pixar characters. Snoo’s new 3D form—and a new menu of emoji-like Snoos—opens the door for the character’s next act. It also lays the groundwork for a new core illustration style, transitioning from spot illustrations that lack a common thread, to heroic 3D icons, all unified in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the industrial firms that Marx and Smith wrote about, tech firms like Google differ in one key aspect: how they turn a profit. Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say. For companies like Google, rent comes from owning the infrastructure through which we live our digital lives. The vast majority of Google’s windfall profits—$60 billion in 2022—come from rents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing to say other than read this piece. Wow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From January to December, 2020, <strong>64.82% of searches</strong> on Google (desktop and mobile combined) ended in the search results without clicking to another web property. That number is likely undercounting some mobile and nearly all voice searches, and thus it’s probable that more than 2/3rds of all Google searches are what I’ve been calling “zero-click searches.”</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m using defined tags to filter my public bookmarks. Posts with lots of ads will be tagged as &ldquo;<strong>adicles</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;posts&rdquo; tag is exclusive to personal &ldquo;sites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; come from &ldquo;orgs&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies,&rdquo; so forth, and so on.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>
